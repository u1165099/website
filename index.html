<h3>Experience</h3>

<hr>
Pac-Man Game - Collaborative Project                  <br>
	Created and tested 16-bit CPU on a Cyclone-V FPGA written in Verilog <br>
	Integrated Raspberry Pi, Xbox One controller, and VGA display to interface with our CPU <br>
	Created an assembler that converts assembly code into machine code <br>
	Developed original software for the movement of ghosts, Pacman, and the game states, in machine language <br>
TankWars Game - Collaborative Project                     			<br>
	Recreated tank wars game using client/server architecture, allowing multiple clients to connect to a server <br>
	Used JSON to represent and send information from client to server and vice versa using TCP in C# <br>
	Used MVC architecture in order to have separation of concerns <br>
CPU Design - Independent Project                         					 <br>
	Simulated and synthesized a 4-bit ALU, datapath, and tri-state buffers modularly in Verilog <br>
	Then implemented a finite state machine <br>
	Interfaced all the components together for a 4-bit CPU and controller for a microprocessor or microcontroller <br>
Sensor Systems - Independent Project                         			 <br>
	Designed and simulated a simple sensor system to detect the temperature with a MS97 thermistor <br>
	Built the circuit using insulating tiles to heat up or a convection current fan to cool down <br>
Infrared Signals - Collaborative Project 					        <br>
	Coded programs on Arduinos (in C++) to send and receive messages using infrared transmissions <br>
	Built a sender and receiver to work with obstructions in between the two Arduinos <br>

<h3>Expectation</h3>
<hr> I currently work part time as a lab aide. I would like to get started with the project over the summer. I am open to working with anybody that will put in the time and effort needed to complete our final project. <br>
